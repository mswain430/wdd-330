        spawning: 'In Java Edition, villagers can summon iron golems, either when they are gossiping or panicking. When a villager tries to summon a golem, up to 10 attempts are made to spawn a golem within a 16x13x16 box centered on the villager (villager block position +7/-8 blocks along x/z axes and +6/-6 blocks along y axis). A random column is picked and then the topmost block in that column is selected that is air, water, or lava, and has a "solid-blocking" block underneath, or block at y=+6 if none such is available in that column. The target location is then checked whether the block underneath has a solid top surface (which is not the same as "solid-blocking"). The target block and 2 blocks above must not be a full block nor be redstone-powered nor be rails, and the two blocks above must not be water. This means the iron golem can spawn inside 1-deep water or inside blocks like halfslabs, fences, and carpets (if other checks pass). Adjacent blocks are irrelevant, so golems can even spawn partially inside adjacent solid blocks resulting in their own suffocation and death.[1] However, the spawning iron golem still must not collide with any existing mobs. In Bedrock Edition, an iron golem can spawn naturally when a village first generates in the world. Iron golems also spawn in villages having at least 21 beds and 10 villagers, in a 16×6×16 volume around the village center defined by a bed, a bell, or another meeting point. The chance of spawning is 1⁄7000 per game tick, which averages to one every 5 minutes and 50 seconds. Iron golems can spawn provided the blocks it spawns in are non-solid and the block it spawns on has a solid flat top surface.'

Spiders have a 1% chance to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a spider jockey. Skeleton horsemen spawn when a skeleton trap is triggered. The skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted bows and iron helmets, and have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning."
