Drag & drop

3 steps: There are several steps to adding drag and drop to your page:

1. Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable.
2. Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements.
3. Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you want to have accept dropped items.

draggable="true"
var mouse = null;
for (var i=0; i < mice.length; i++) {
mouse = mice[i];
mouse.addEventListener('dragstart', function (event) {
// handle the dragstart event
});
}
